"negative","I tried Pristiq for 3 months with no good results. I have social anxiety disorder and typically only
become anxious around people. When on this medication I became anxious 24/7 and the intensity of the
anxiety increased. I also suffer from depression. This medication took away all of my good thoughts
and negative ones as well. It left me feeling empty and like a robot. I could not talk to people. I
have asperger is syndrome as well and almost lost the ability to speak when on this medication. It
is horrible I would not recommend it for anyone who suffers from anxiety, depression, or aspergers."
"negative","This made my arms itch really bad and kept me up."
"positive","I would been drinking and getting drunk for 25 yrs. I have driven drunk to many times to count. By
God is grace I never hurt myself or anyone else, or ever been pulled over by the cops. I recently
lost what I think could of been the love of my life. My words were harmful when I got drunk. He had
enough and will not except another apology from me nor my many attempts to contact him. I had to do
something. Naltrexone is changing my life! I cannot wait to get used to not overdoing it. I cannot
wait to be in a relationship without cursing him out due to me overdoing it. Hopefully I can get
back the love of my life one day but for now I am working on myself. I little bored and and little
lonely but me being sober is worth it."
"positive","Tension Headache. I had taken 10 mg 3x day for years with no results. In titrating up to 20 mg 4x
per day I have had miraculous results in relieving daily tension headaches. No side effects. Highly
recommended."
"positive","I am 42 and I have been on 60mg Axiron for 6 weeks. Initial total T was 240 with all the symptoms of
low T. Today my total is 840 and free is 248. I feel fantastic. The first couple of days were tough
as my body adjusted. The only down side for me is the minor alcohol irritation after application
but well worth it. Initially starting this medication my skin was oily, libido was out of control,
my facial hair seemed to grow in within minutes, I was retaining water and my scrotum shriveled up.
After a week or so everything returned to ""normal"". No back hair or sudden muscle bulk. No gyno or
roid rage. The product works great for me and I was shocked as it seems everyone likes bashing the
topicals and raving about injections."
