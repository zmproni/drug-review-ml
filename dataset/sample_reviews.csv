"negative","I am retired, but still read and do many other activities. I was taking MsContin 30mg 3x and
Oxycodone IR 10mg 4x per day. I stopped reading and crocheting. I stopped watching my favorite
programs. I never knew when I was going to fall asleep. I became hostile, angry, depressed, paranoid
and had substantial memory loss. I stopped talking to people and was tired all the time. I didn't
connect it to my pain medication because I have numerous chronic illnesses. Last year my doctor
suggested a change to Oxycontin, but I was afraid. A month ago I started taking Oxycodone IR 10mg
four times a day and Xtampza 18mg three times per day. I wish I had done it sooner. I have eat a
good meal with the Xtampza but,I am awake and my real personality is back. My energy is up."
"positive","I've struggled with binge eating every since I was in middle school and I'm now 33. Nothing ever
worked for me until Vyvanse. The biggest thing for me is that I no longer obsess over food. I would
think about food all day long and all night until I managed to fall asleep. I never knew what hunger
truly was because I always used food to control my emotions. Vyvanse controls the compulsions and
obsessions I once had over food. An added plus is that I've lost 8 pounds in about 3 weeks since
I've started taking it. I no longer binge and its the strangest yet most incredible feeling in the
world. I would have rated this a 10 but I'm only 3 wks in so hopefully the effects are long lasting."
"positive","I've experienced RLS for over 20 years. After trying various techniques I finally resorted to
medication. I started with 2.5 mg diazepam before bed time with good success. After some major back
surgery, I could no longer use diazepam and was prescribed all Clonazepam 1mg before bed. After
a few months due to excessive drowsiness I lowered to 0.5mg and was able to reduce the overall
drowsiness factor and still able to control the RLS. If I have a bad night I will take another 0.5mg
if needed. I've tried Lyricia and Oxycodone with poor results. I have not had any addictive issues
with any of my meds. As a side note, I've also tried 420 with poor results."
"positive","Cymbalta has given me my life back. I finally feel like me again. The loving, caring, free-spirited
person I had forgotten about. I can finally function, which is so important to me. I am getting a
4.0 in college. I feel like a walking miracle! I can't believe where I am today; that a pill could
literally save my life. I was so close to suicide, so violent, and so depressed. I wanted to die.
I'm FINALLY HAPPY! It's sad that Cymbalta has low reviews from people withdrawing from it. I'm sure
it's difficult. But does that take away from how much it helps!? I might be on it the rest of my
life, who knows?"
"negative","I was prescribed Tenuate extended-release tabs because of my caffeine sensitivity. Of course, I
noticed a change but not the jittery/shaky feeling that comes with harsh stimulants. My side effects
included nausea, constipation, blurred vision (which I didn't associate to the meds). I lost 15
pounds over a three month period including the winter holiday period but noticed after that I was
not losing anymore. Two months later and a 6 lb weight gain, I've decided to stop taking the meds.
Immediately, I noticed extreme exhaustion and an inability to get going."
